First—huge respect for making this decision. At 6'4", 470 lbs, you have a big engine. Your goal (lose fat, keep muscle) is absolutely achievable with the right structure, not extreme cardio or crash dieting.

Below is a joint-friendly, heavy-lifting-focused plan built for:

Fat loss

Muscle preservation (and even gains at first)

Sustainability

A 2 days on / 1 day off schedule

A gym with machines + free weights

I’ll give you:

Training philosophy (important at your size)

Weekly split (simple + repeatable)

Exact gym routine (sets/reps/rest)

Cardio guidance (minimal but smart)

Protein + nutrition targets

Progress rules (how to know it’s working)

1️⃣ Training Philosophy (Critical at Your Size)

You will succeed faster if you:

Lift heavy enough to stimulate muscle

Avoid high-impact cardio

Use machines liberally (they’re not cheating)

Train 60–75 minutes max

Progress slowly but consistently

👉 You do NOT need:

Bootcamp workouts

HIIT circuits

Running

7 days/week training

Fat loss comes from:

Calorie control + resistance training

2️⃣ Weekly Schedule (2 On / 1 Off)

This repeats continuously.

Day	Workout
Day 1	Upper Body (Push + Pull)
Day 2	Lower Body + Core
Day 3	Rest / Active Recovery
Repeat	🔁

You’ll train 4–5 days/week naturally without burnout.

3️⃣ DAILY GYM ROUTINES (Exact Plan)
🔹 Day 1 — Upper Body (Machines + Free Weights)

Warm-Up (10 min)

5 min treadmill walk or recumbent bike

6. Plank (Incline or Elevated if needed)

3 rounds of 20–40 seconds

🚶 Cardio Cooldown

5–10 min walking or bike

4️⃣ Cardio Rules (Do NOT Overdo This)

At your size:

Cardio is support, not the main event

Your lifts already burn a lot of calories

Best Options:

Incline walking

Recumbent bike

Elliptical (if comfortable)

Swimming (excellent if available)

Target:

15–25 minutes max on lifting days

Optional light walk on rest days

5️⃣ Protein & Nutrition (Fat Loss Without Muscle Loss)
🥩 Protein Target (Very Important)

👉 200–240g protein/day

That’s not based on bodyweight—it's based on lean mass preservation.

Simple Rules:

Protein at every meal

No liquid calories

Lift days ≠ cheat days

Example Protein Sources:

Chicken breast

Lean beef

Eggs / egg whites

Greek yogurt

Protein shakes (2/day is fine)

Cottage cheese

Fish

Calories (Rough Start)

You’ll likely lose fat well at:

~3,000–3,400 calories/day

We adjust after 2–3 weeks based on scale + measurements.

6️⃣ Progress Rules (How You Know It’s Working)

Ignore daily scale changes.

Track weekly:

Bodyweight (same time, same day)

Waist measurement

Strength numbers

How clothes fit

Winning Signs:

✅ Strength going up
✅ Waist shrinking
✅ Energy improving
✅ Recovery improving

If weight stalls for 3 weeks straight → small calorie cut or add 10 min cardio.

7️⃣ Safety & Longevity Rules (Important)

Machines are your friend

No ego lifting

If something hurts (sharp pain) → stop

Sleep 7–8 hours if possible

Hydrate heavily

Final Thought

At your size and age, you’re in the PERFECT position to experience:

Rapid fat loss

Strength gains

Huge momentum

You don’t need perfection—you need consistency.


🔑 THE GOLDEN RULE (Use This Everywhere)

Your starting weight should let you:

Hit the LOW end of the rep range on set 1

Finish your last set with 1–2 reps left in the tank (RIR)

Maintain perfect form on every rep

If you could do 5+ more reps → too light
If you barely survive the last rep → too heavy

DAY 1 — UPPER BODY STARTING WEIGHTS
1️⃣ Chest Press (Machine or Barbell Bench)

Rep Range: 6–10

Conservative but Strong Starting Points:

Machine chest press:
👉 ~50–60% of the stack

Barbell bench:
👉 135–185 lbs

If 185 feels too easy, slow the tempo before adding weight.

Test Set:
Do 8 reps

If rep 8 moves fast → add 10–20 lbs

If rep 6 already grinds → drop weight

2️⃣ Lat Pulldown

Rep Range: 8–12

👉 Start at ~60–70% of your bodyweight

For you:

250–300 lbs is common for strong bigger guys
(Yes—this surprises people)

Cue:

Chest up

Pull elbows to ribs

No swinging

3️⃣ Seated Row Machine

Rep Range: 10–12

👉 Start at 60–70% of stack

You should feel:

Lats and mid-back burning

Not biceps dominating

If you can slam the weight → it’s too heavy.

4️⃣ Shoulder Press (Machine or DBs)

Rep Range: 8–12

Machine: 40–60% stack

Dumbbells: 35–55 lbs each

Go slower here—shoulders get beat up fast at heavier bodyweights.

5️⃣ Triceps Pushdown

Rep Range: 12–15

👉 Start at 70–90 lbs

If elbows flare or shoulders move → drop weight.

6️⃣ Biceps (Machine or DB)

Rep Range: 12–15

DBs: 25–40 lbs

Machine: 50–70 lbs

Arms grow from control, not momentum.

DAY 2 — LOWER BODY STARTING WEIGHTS
1️⃣ Leg Press (Big Lift)

Rep Range: 8–12

👉 Start at:

2.5–3× bodyweight total including sled

For you:

900–1,100 lbs total is very realistic

Foot placement:

Feet slightly higher

Knees track over toes

If knees feel sketchy → drop depth slightly.

2️⃣ Romanian Deadlift (DB or Barbell)

Rep Range: 8–10

Barbell: 135–225 lbs

Dumbbells: 50–80 lbs each

This is a hamstring stretch, not a lower-back pull.

If your back feels it more than your hamstrings → too heavy.

3️⃣ Seated Hamstring Curl

Rep Range: 12–15

👉 70–110 lbs

Slow negatives (3 seconds down).

4️⃣ Calf Raises

Rep Range: 12–15

Seated: 90–140 lbs

Standing: Bodyweight + 45–90 lbs

Pause at the top.

5️⃣ Core Work

Cable Crunch

60–100 lbs

Plank

Bodyweight

Elevate hands if needed

🔄 FIRST WEEK PROGRESSION RULE

For the first 2 weeks:

Do NOT chase max weights

Focus on:

Reps hitting cleanly

Zero joint pain

Consistent performance across sets

Once you can hit the TOP end of reps on all sets:
👉 Add 10–20 lbs next session

🚨 Red Flags (Back Off If You Feel These)

❌ Knee pain on leg press
❌ Shoulder pinch on presses
❌ Lower back strain on RDLs
❌ Needing momentum to move weight

Strength means control.

🔥 Why This Works for You Specifically

At 470 lbs:

You already have high baseline strength

Your nervous system is primed for heavy loads

You’ll retain muscle extremely well in a deficit

If you lift intelligently, you’ll:

Lose fat faster than lighter beginners

Maintain (or gain) muscle

Avoid burnout and injury
